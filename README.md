# React Interview Practice

A curated collection of **small, focused React exercises** designed to demonstrate **core concepts, hooks, and patterns** commonly tested in frontend interviews.

This repository prioritizes **clarity, correctness, and explanation** over visual polish.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project exists to:

- Practice React fundamentals in isolation
- Build strong mental models for hooks and state
- Prepare for **junior → mid frontend interviews**
- Serve as a **talking point** during technical interviews

Each exercise focuses on **one concept at a time** and includes short explanations.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered So Far

### 1. State Management (`useState`)
- Initializing state
- Updating state based on previous values
- Functional updates
- Avoiding stale state bugs

### 2. Controlled Components
- Inputs controlled by React state
- Live preview updates
- React as the single source of truth
- When controlled inputs are preferred

### 3. Uncontrolled Components (`useRef`)
- DOM-managed inputs
- Reading values on submit
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- When uncontrolled inputs make sense

### 4. `useRef` Fundamentals
- Accessing DOM elements safely
- Managing focus imperatively
- Persisting mutable values across renders
- Tracking render counts without re-rendering

### 5. Accessibility Basics
- Proper usage of `<label>` and `htmlFor`
- Input `id` association
- Semantic HTML in forms
