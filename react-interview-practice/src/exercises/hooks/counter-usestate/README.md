## Counter (useState)

**Concept:** State management with `useState` and functional updates.

### What this demonstrates

- Initializing state
- Updating state based on previous value
- Why functional updates (`previousCount => previousCount + 1`) are safer
- Handling multiple actions (increment, decrement, reset)

### Note

Functional updates prevent bugs when multiple state updates happen quickly.
